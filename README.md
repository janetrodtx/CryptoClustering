# CryptoClustering
Summary of Cryptocurrency Market Clustering Analysis

In this analysis, I performed clustering on cryptocurrency market data using K-Means and optimized it with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Initial Clustering with K-Means:

Standardized price change percentage data across various timeframes.
Identified the optimal number of clusters (k=4) using the Elbow Method.
Assigned cryptocurrencies to clusters based on their price change behavior.
PCA Optimization:

Reduced data dimensionality to three principal components, preserving 89.5% of the variance.
Repeated the clustering process with PCA-transformed data to enhance interpretability.
Key Findings:

Cryptocurrencies exhibit distinct price movement patterns that can be grouped into meaningful segments.
PCA effectively reduced noise while retaining essential market trends.
The clustering results can help in understanding market behavior and categorizing cryptocurrencies based on performance trends.
